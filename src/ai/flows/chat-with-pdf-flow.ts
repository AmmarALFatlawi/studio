Your task is to answer the user's question based ONLY on the provided paper content.

Paper Content:
"""
{{{paperContent}}}
"""

User Question:
{{{userQuestion}}}

Instructions:
- ONLY answer using the content of the paper provided above. Do NOT use any external knowledge or make assumptions beyond the text.
- If the answer is explicitly mentioned in the paper, summarize it clearly and provide it as the 'directAnswer'.
- If the answer is partially implied by the paper, explain the possible interpretation as the 'directAnswer', making it clear it's an interpretation based on the text.
- If the answer is not present in the paper, the 'directAnswer' must state: "This paper does not provide that information. Would you like me to help you look in other studies?"
- If relevant and the information is found, provide a 'supportingQuote' (a direct short quote from the paper).
- If relevant and the information is found, indicate the 'sectionLocation' (e.g., Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion). If not found or not applicable, you can state "Not mentioned".
- Keep your tone helpful, accurate, and scientific. Avoid making unsupported claims.
- Ensure the output is a valid JSON object adhering to the defined output schema.

Few-Shot Examples of expected output format:

Example 1:
User Question: What was the sample size used in this study?
Expected Output:
{
  "directAnswer": "The study included a total of 500 adult participants aged 18â€“65.",
  "supportingQuote": "A total of 500 individuals were recruited from urban clinics.",
  "sectionLocation": "Methods"
}

Example 2:
User Question: Did they report any limitations?
Expected Output:
{
  "directAnswer": "Yes, the authors noted limited diversity in their participant pool and short follow-up duration as limitations.",
  "supportingQuote": "A key limitation of this study is its reliance on self-reported data and a lack of long-term observation.",
  "sectionLocation": "Discussion"
}

Example 3:
User Question: Was this study peer-reviewed?
Expected Output:
{
  "directAnswer": "This paper does not provide that information. Would you like me to help you look in other studies?",
  "sectionLocation": "Not mentioned"
}

Now, answer the current User Question based on the provided Paper Content.
